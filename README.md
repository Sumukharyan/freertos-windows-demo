## Day 6

- Implemented multitasking application using FreeRTOS kernel
- Created concurrent tasks with different priorities
- Used FreeRTOS delay and scheduler APIs

## Day 7

- Implemented inter-task communication using FreeRTOS queues
- Designed producer–consumer architecture
- Ensured thread-safe data transfer between tasks

## Day 8: Semaphores & Mutexes (RTOS Synchronization)

- Implemented task synchronization using FreeRTOS binary semaphores
- Designed event-driven signaling between producer and consumer tasks
- Used blocking synchronization (`xSemaphoreTake`) to avoid CPU busy-waiting
- Implemented mutex-based protection for shared resources
- Understood and applied priority inheritance to prevent priority inversion
